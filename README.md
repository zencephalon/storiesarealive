Stories are Alive
====================================

Grow your stories with your friends and watch them flourish.

TODO:
# Refactor Draft class to actually be object oriented
# Create similar class for users
# Store repositories by number on disk
# Draft update, obviously an important component
# Actually link to the drafts on the list page
# Draft view url should have user in the url, duh
